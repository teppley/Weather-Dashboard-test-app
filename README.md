# Weather-Dashboard-test-app

Description:

This is an assigment in which I had to build a weather application. This application displays the current and five day forecast for a searched city. It has a side search panel to enter a city in the text box, as well as search button to initailze the search. When a city is searched the results for today are displayed. It also displays the 5 day forecast under the current weather. The use of weather apis were implemented to retrieve weather data. The forecast displays the city, date, temperature, humidity, wind speed, and uv index. Previously searched cities are saved to local storage and will appear after closing or refreshing the page. Search history can be cleared using the red "Clear Search History" button.

Usage:

To utilize my assignment, you may use it from my github repository.
